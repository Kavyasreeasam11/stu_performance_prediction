#stu_performance_prediction
Machine Learning Project to predict student performance using real world data

Student Performance Prediction

This machine learning project predicts student exam scores based on features like hours studied, attendance, sleep, and motivation level.

Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
- Jupyter Notebook
  
Project Highlights
- Achieved RÂ² score of 75% using Random Forest Regressor
- Analyzed feature importances
- Compared models (Linear vs Random Forest)
- Visualized score distributions and model performance

Dataset
- Real-world educational dataset with 6600+ records and 20 features
